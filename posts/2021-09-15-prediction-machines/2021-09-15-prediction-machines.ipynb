    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As economists, the authors claim that it is part of their job to strip away the hype around important technological changes to identify their true value. According to them, AI is a prediction technology, not actual intelligence, and predictions are inputs to decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Alexa doesn’t “know” the capital of Delaware, but is able to predict that, when asked such a question, people are looking for a specific response: “Dover.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of putting this is that AI **reduces the cost of prediction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creative Destruction Labs (CDL) leverages this insight in such a way that each startup they work with focus on exploiting the benefits of better prediction For instance, Deep Genomics tries to improve the practice of medicine by predicting what will happen in a cell when DNA is altered, and Chisel improves the practice of law by predicting which parts of a document to redact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Economics provides a perfect framework for understanding the trade-offs underlying any decision and the role of artificial intelligence. While many are still trying to grasp AI, the economic principles and implications of changes to cost are clearly defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not the purpose of this book to describe the best strategy for any company, the emphasis is on trade-offs. For example, more data usually means less privacy, more speed means less accuracy, and more autonomy means less control. It is up to the decision-makers to use the structure given in this book to analyze these trade-offs in order to make their decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cheap changes everything**\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, this book is about strategic thinking using economic principles. It starts by giving past examples of past technological innovations seen as the fall in price of something:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rise of the internet was a drop in the cost of distribution, communication, and search. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Google made search cheap. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Computers made arithmetic cheap. \n",
    "\n",
    "The consequences for these changes in price was that substitutes like the Yellow Pages in search lost value while an increase in search (due to a lower price) meant that certain companies that relied on others finding them prospered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of arithmetic, a reduction in price also means increased demand in new areas were arithmetic was not traditionally used. For example, photography used to be mainly chemistry and then became highly digital.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the authors view AI as prediction technology. **Prediction is the process of filling in missing information. Prediction takes information you have, often called “data,” and uses it to generate information you don’t have.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with arithmetic, we can then expect to see problems fro other domains being transformed into prediction problems. A clear example of this is transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, people tried to program autonomous vehicles using conditional logic. This system was very limited and brittle because it is practically impossible for humans to program rules for all the scenarios needed. A breakthrough came when this problem was translated into a prediction problem. At any given moment, what would a human do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from changes in demand and impact on substitutes, economic theory also points us toward complements. We would expect complements to have higher value. \n",
    "\n",
    "A practical example of this would be that if the cost of prediction drops, then the value of data collection technology should increase (like Israeli startup Mobileye in the case of autonomous vehicles, which was bought by Intel for more than $15 billion).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The drop in the cost of prediction will impact the value of other things, increasing the value of complements (data, judgment, and action) and diminishing the value of substitutes (human prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note}\n",
    "This reminded me about a comment in the book _A more beautiful question_ where the author argues that in today's world information and answers have become commodities. This drop in the cost of accessing information has increased the value of asking good questions, which could be a key component of good judgement. For more about the value of questions, see [my notes on the book \"A more beautiful question\"](../2021-04-27-a-more-beautiful-question/2021-04-27-a-more-beautiful-question.ipynb)\n",

    "## Part One: Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's called intelligence**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few chapters explore fundamental concepts like machine learning and how it is different to traditional statistics and algorithms based on if-then conditional rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual coding of rules doesn't work well in very complex environments. Effective automatic prediction puts programming upside-down such that we don't have to write the whole program. Instead, we train a model that becomes the program we use for prediction and the improvements in performance are often transformational.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data is the new oil**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main trade-offs when making strategic decisions about AI is connected to data and, more specifically, data acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models depend on data for training. as a general rule of thumb, more and better data usually improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In economic terms, data is a key complement to prediction. It becomes more valuable as prediction becomes cheaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering prediction algorithms to solve a problem, it becomes important to consider what degree of data freshness might be needed, what type of data, how much data, and so on. For example, collecting data often, such as multiple times every hour, tends to be much more expensive than collecting data once a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we answer these questions? Usually we find guidance by thinking about the prediction problem we are working on. If we need a model that is 99% accurate for it to be useful we'll usually need much more data than if we only need to reach a 70% accuracy. There is a set of tools we can use for this called \"power calculations\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Business leaders also need to understand if data has increasing or diminishing returns at scale. Generally, if we have a lot of data then a few more data points would not add much value (diminishing returns), but in problems with many edge cases like recommendation systems there might be increasing value as we get access to data points that competitors will have a tough time obtaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The new division of labor**\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, we use different types of resources to complete tasks or solve problems. To make effective strategic decisions we need to understand what tasks should be assigned to humans and which can be assigned to machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky discovered with their Prospect Theory that humans are not good utility optimzers, we usually give too much weight to short-term impact and more on losses than gains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Framing of information can lead to significantly different actions. When considering a surgery, Kahneman and Tversky found that 84% of physicians would go with surgery if they were told that “the one-month survival rate is 90 percent” compared to only 50% when they were told that “there is a 10 percent mortality in the first month”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, as we can see in the experiment above, we are systematically biased and rely on multiple heuristics even when we are aware that they exist. Statistical thinking does not come naturally to us, machines would not change their behavior in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans and machines are also well suited for different types of problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Known knowns**. Wwe have rich data and machine prediction can work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Known unknowns**. We know that we don't have much data and this will impact performance of predictive models while humans are sometimes very good at predicting with limited data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unknown unknowns**. When something has ever happened before, both humans and machines tend to be bad at making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unknown knowns**. Here the authors point out that there are times when prediction machines give us the wrong answers with a very high level of confidence. This usually happens when the machine does not understand the data-generating process. A common source for this is the presence of confounder variables, such that a naive prediction might suggest that increasing the price would lead to more rooms sold just because both of these events tend to happen together during tourist season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, sometimes the best performance is obtained when humans and machines work together. This is because humans and machines tend to be good at different aspects of a prediction. For example, humans might be better at reducing false positives while the prediction model might be more suited for reducing false negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "The book presents an example of this when Harvard/MIT team of AI researchers won a contest in 2016 to detect breast cancer. Their deep learning algorithm had an accuracy of 92.5 percent and human pathologists were right 96.6 of the time. Combining their predictions, accuracy increased to 99.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An important question for business leaders is how to combine human and machine predictions**. The book cites a randomized controlled trial by Daniel Paravisini and Antoinette Schoar where a committee in a bank reviewing loan applicants were given the machine prediction before or after presenting their own assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "They found that both ways of working improved performance of their decisions, but their was an even higher improvement when the prediction was served in advance. This option empowered low-level managers with information to make more accurate decisions and needed less help from their superiors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Presenting the score after the assessment gave high-level managers a tool to monitor the low-level managers and evaluate their decisions, which gave them an incentive to work harder and ensure that they were making high quality decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very effective way of combining predictions could also be through prediction by exception such that the machine automatically serves predictions for common events, but calls for human assistance when a rare event is presented and the model has low confidence in the predicted value. \n"

    "## Part 2: Decision making\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unpacking decision**\n",
    "\n",
    "A prediction is not a decision. Making a decision requires applying judgment to a prediction and then acting. Before recent advances in machine intelligence, this distinction was only of academic interest because humans always performed prediction and judgment together. Now, advances in machine prediction mean that we have to examine the anatomy of a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the prediction with judgment on what matters, the decision maker can then choose an action. The action leads to an outcome (which has an associated reward or payoff). The outcome is a consequence of the decision. It is needed to provide a complete picture. The outcome may also provide feedback to help improve the next prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As machine prediction increasingly replaces the predictions that humans make, the value of human prediction will decline. But a key point is that, while prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision—judgment, data, and action—remain, for now, firmly in the realm of humans. They are complements to prediction, meaning they increase in value as prediction becomes cheap. For example, we may be more willing to exert effort by applying judgment to decisions where we previously had decided not to decide (e.g., accepted the default) because prediction machines now offer better, faster, and cheaper predictions. In that case, the demand for human judgment will increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "When high-quality machine prediction became cheap, human prediction declined in value, so the cabbies were worse off. The number of rides in London’s black cabs fell. Instead, other people provided the same service. These others also had driving skills and human sensors, complementary assets that went up in value as prediction became cheap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Judgment is the process of determining the reward to a particular action in a particular environment. It is about working out the objective you’re actually pursuing. Judgment involves determining what we call the “reward function,” the relative rewards and penalties associated with taking particular actions that produce particular outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As prediction becomes better, faster, and cheaper, we’ll use more of it to make more decisions, so we’ll also need more human judgment and thus the value of human judgment will go up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 8: The value of judgement\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction machines don’t provide judgment. Only humans do, because only humans can express the relative rewards from taking different actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit card networks such as Mastercard, Visa, and American Express predict and judge all the time. They have to predict whether card applicants meet their standards for credit worthiness. If the individual doesn’t, then the company will deny them credit. You might think that’s pure prediction, but a significant element of judgment is involved as well. Being credit worthy is a sliding scale, and the credit card company has to decide how much risk it’s willing to take on at different interest and default rates. Those decisions lead to significantly different business models—the difference between American Express’s high-end platinum card and an entry-level card aimed at college students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Judging payoffs requires time and effort: more outcomes mean more judgment means more time and effort. Humans experience the cognitive costs of judgment as a slower decision-making process. We all have to decide how much we want to pin down the payoffs against the costs of delaying a decision. Some will choose not to investigate payoffs for scenarios that seem remote or unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Judgment, whether by deliberation or experimentation, is costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty means you need judgment when the prediction turns out to be wrong, not just when the prediction is right. In other words, uncertainty increases the cost of judging the payoffs for a given decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figuring out the rewards from these various actions—the key piece of judgment—is reward function engineering, a fundamental part of what humans do in the decision-making process. Prediction machines are a tool for humans. So long as humans are needed to weigh outcomes and impose judgment, they have a key role to play as prediction machines improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 9: Predicting judgement\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental question, at least for humans, is whether AI can turn its predictive powers on human judgment and, in the process, circumvent the need for humans altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machines may learn to predict human judgment by showing them many examples and rewarding them for predicting human judgment: What would a human do in this situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are limits to the ability of machines to predict human judgment. The limits relate to lack of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machines are bad at prediction for rare events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 10: Taming complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of good prediction, we do a lot of “satisficing,” making decisions that are “good enough” given the information available. Always leaving early for the airport and often waiting once you arrive because you’re early is an example of satisficing. That solution is not optimal, but it’s good enough given the information available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airport lounges and biopsies are both risk management solutions. The lounge exists because you are likely to arrive early for your flight. Prediction machines will provide new and better methods for managing risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Better prediction, by reducing or eliminating a key source of uncertainty, eliminates your need to have a place to wait at the airport. More critically, better prediction enables new actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 12: Deconstructing workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In the midst of the IT revolution, businesses asked, “How should we implement computers in our business?” For some, the answer was easy: “Find where we do lots of calculations and substitute computers for humans; they’re better, faster, and cheaper.” For other businesses, it was less obvious. Nonetheless, they experimented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1993, Michael Hammer and James Champy, in their book Reengineering the Corporation, argued that to use the new general-purpose technology—computers—businesses needed to step back from their processes and outline the objective they wanted to achieve. Businesses then needed to study their work flow and identify the tasks required to achieve their objective and only then consider whether computers had a role in those tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like classical computing, AI is a general-purpose technology. It has the potential to affect every decision, because prediction is a key input to decision making. Hence, no manager is going to achieve large gains in productivity by just “throwing some AI” at a problem or into an existing process. Instead, AI is the type of technology that requires rethinking processes in the same way that Hammer and Champy did.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now seen more than 150 AI companies in the CDL, our laboratory that helps science-based companies grow. Each one is focused on the development of an AI tool that addresses a specific task in a specific work flow. One startup predicts the most important passages of a document and highlights them. Another predicts manufacturing defects and flags them. Yet another forecasts appropriate customer service responses and answers queries. And the list goes on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large corporations are comprised of work flows that turn inputs into outputs. Work flows are made up of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deciding how to implement AI, companies will break their work flows down into tasks, estimate the ROI for building or buying an AI to perform each task, rank-order the AIs in terms of ROI, and then start from the top of the list and begin working downward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 13: Decomposing decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "We found it useful to separate the parts of a decision into each of its elements: prediction, input, judgment, training, action, outcome, and feedback. In the process, we developed an “AI canvas” to help decompose tasks in order to understand the potential role of a prediction machine. The canvas is an aid for contemplating, building, and assessing AI tools. It provides discipline in identifying each component of a task’s decision. It forces clarity in describing each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means identifying the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "- ACTION: What are you trying to do? For Atomwise, it is to test molecules to help cure or prevent disease.\n",
    "- PREDICTION: What do you need to know to make the decision? Atomwise predicts binding affinities of potential molecules and proteins.\n",
    "- JUDGMENT: How do you value different outcomes and errors? Atomwise and its customers set the criterion regarding the relative importance of targeting the disease and the relative costs of potential side effects.\n",
    "- OUTCOME: What are your metrics for task success? For Atomwise, it’s the results of the test. Ultimately, did the test lead to a new drug?\n",
    "- INPUT: What data do you need to run the predictive algorithm? Atomwise uses data on the characteristics of the disease proteins to predict.\n",
    "- TRAINING: What data do you need to train the predictive algorithm? Atomwise employs data on the binding affinity of molecules and proteins, along with molecule and protein characteristics.\n",
    "- FEEDBACK: How can you use the outcomes to improve the algorithm? Atomwise uses test outcomes, regardless of their success, to improve future predictions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "While we may set global business impact as the goal for a prediction machine, the value of accepting a particular student is a matter of judgment. How costly is it to accept a weak student who we wrongly predicted would be among the elite alumni? How costly is it to reject a strong student who we wrongly predicted would be weak? The assessment of that trade-off is “judgment,” an explicit element in the AI canvas. Once we specify the objective of the prediction, identifying the input data needed is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to identify the core prediction at the heart of the task, and this can require AI insight. The effort to answer this question often initiates an existential discussion among the leadership team: “What is our real objective, anyhow?” Prediction requires a specificity not often found in mission statements. For a business school, for example, it is easy to say that they are focused on recruiting the “best” students, but in order to specify the prediction, we need to specify what “best” means—highest salary offer upon graduation? Most likely to assume a CEO role within five years? Most diverse? Most likely to donate back to the school after graduation? Even seemingly straightforward objectives, like profit maximization, are not as simple as they first appear. Should we predict the action to take that will maximize profit this week, this quarter, this year, or this decade? Companies often find themselves having to go back to basics to realign on their objectives and sharpen their mission statement as a first step in their work on their AI strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 14: Job redesign\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers made arithmetic—specifically, adding up lots of things—cheap. One of the first killer apps was to make bookkeeping easy. Why didn’t bookkeepers see the spreadsheet as a threat?\n",
    "\n",
    "A spreadsheet could give you answers easily and, in the process, vastly increased the returns to asking questions. The same people who had laboriously computed the answers before the arrival of the spreadsheet were the best positioned to ask the right questions of the computerized spreadsheet. They were not replaced but rather augmented with superpowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. AI tools may augment jobs, as in the example of spreadsheets and bookkeepers.\n",
    "2. AI tools may contract jobs, as in fulfillment centers. \n",
    "3. AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs, with some tasks added and others taken away, as with radiologists.\n",
    "4. AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job as with bookkeepers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 15: AI in the C-suite\n",
    "\n",
    "C-suite leadership must not fully delegate AI strategy to their IT department because powerful AI tools may go beyond enhancing the productivity of tasks performed in the service of executing against the organization’s strategy and instead lead to changing the strategy itself.\n",
    "\n",
    " AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are present: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. there is a core trade-off in the business model (e.g., shop-then-ship versus ship-then-shop);\n",
    "2. the trade-off is influenced by uncertainty (e.g., higher sales from ship-then-shop are outweighed by higher costs from returned items due to uncertainty about what customers will buy); \n",
    "3. an AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade-off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other (e.g., an AI that reduces uncertainty by predicting what a customer will buy tips the scale such that the returns from a ship-then-shop model outweigh those from the traditional model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction machines will increase the value of complements, including judgment, actions, and data. The increasing value of judgment may lead to changes in organizational hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the simple economics that underlies all the arguments in this book, prediction and judgment are complements; as the use of prediction increases, the value of judgment rises. Teams are increasingly bringing in new senior advisers who sometimes may not have firsthand experience playing the game and—true to stereotype—may not be an obvious fit in the jock world of professional sports. However, even nerds recruited into this setting require a deep understanding of the game because using prediction machines in sports management means an increase in the value of people who have the judgment to determine payoffs and, therefore, the judgment to use predictions in decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better prediction now enables the manager to make decisions that are closer to the organization’s objectives: determining the best team rather than the best individual players. To make the most of prediction machines, you need to rethink the reward functions throughout your organization to better align with your true goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 16: When AI transforms your business\n",
    "\n",
    "A key strategic choice is determining where your business ends and another business begins—deciding on the boundary of the firm. Uncertainty influences this choice. Because prediction machines reduce uncertainty, they can influence the boundary between your organization and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reducing uncertainty, prediction machines increase the ability to write contracts, and thus increase the incentive for companies to contract out both capital equipment and labor that focuses on data, prediction, and action. However, prediction machines decrease the incentive for companies to contract out labor that focuses on judgment. Judgment quality is hard to specify in a contract and difficult to monitor. If judgment could be well specified, then it could be programmed and we wouldn’t need humans to provide it. Since judgment is likely to be the key role for human labor as AI diffuses, in-house employment will rise and contracting out labor will fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI might enable machines to operate in more complex environments. It expands the number of reliable “ifs,” thus lessening a business’s need to own its own capital equipment, for two reasons. First, more “ifs” means that a business can write contracts to specify what to do if something unusual happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, AI-driven prediction—all the way to predicting consumer satisfaction—would enable companies to more confidently design products up front, thus leading to high consumer satisfaction and performance without the consequent need for extensive mid-model adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies found that automobile companies that are parts themselves improved faster, but companies that used external providers had higher initial satisfaction due to higher quality of the parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what the impact on outsourcing would be if processes become more complex since better prediction drives more outsourcing, while more complexity tends to reduce it. Which of these factors might dominate is hard to say at this stage. We can say that, while newly feasible complex processes might be done in house, many of the simpler processes previously completed in house will be outsourced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The direct implication of this line of economic logic is that AI will shift HR management toward the relational and away from the transactional. The reason is twofold. First, human judgment, where it is valuable, is utilized because it is difficult to program such judgment into a machine. The rewards are either unstable or unknown, or require human experience to implement. Second, to the extent that human judgment becomes more important when machine predictions proliferate, such judgment necessarily involves subjective means of performance evaluation. If objective means are available, chances are that a machine could make such judgment without the need for any HR management. Thus, humans are critical to decision making where the goals are subjective. For that reason, the management of such people will likely be more relational.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another critical strategic issue is the ownership and control of data. For AI startups, owning the data that allows them to learn is particularly crucial. Otherwise, they will be unable to improve their product over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many AI leaders, including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, have built or purchased their own advertising networks so that they can own this valuable data. They decided that owning this data is worth the cost of acquiring it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and a handful of other companies have particularly useful data on consumer preferences online. Rather than only sell data, they go a step further to make predictions for advertisers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you collect your own data and make predictions or buy them from others depends on the importance of prediction machines to your company. If the prediction machine is an input that you can take off the shelf, then you can treat it like most companies treat energy and purchase it from the market, as long as AI is not core to your strategy. In contrast, if prediction machines are to be the center of your company’s strategy, then you need to control the data to improve the machine, so both the data and the prediction machine must be in house.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 17: Your learning strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Shifting to an AI-first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. In other words, AI-first is not a buzz word—it represents a real tradeoff. An AI-first strategy places maximizing prediction accuracy as the central goal of the organization, even if that means compromising on other goals such as maximizing revenue, user numbers, or user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The economist’s filter knows that any statement of “we will put our attention into X” means a trade-off. Something will always be given up in exchange. AI-first means devoting resources to data collection and learning (a longer-term objective) at the expense of important short-term considerations such as immediate customer experience, revenue, and user numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central strategic dilemma is whether to prioritize that learning or instead shield others from the performance sacrifices that entails.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the classic “innovator’s dilemma,” (Clay Christensen) whereby established firms do not want to disrupt their existing customer relationships, even if doing so would be better in the long run. The innovator’s dilemma occurs because, when they first appear, innovations might not be good enough to serve the customers of the established companies in an industry, but they may be good enough to provide a new startup with enough customers in some niche area to build a product. Over time, the startup gains experience. Eventually, the startup has learned enough to create a strong product that takes away its larger rival’s customers. By that point, the larger company is too far behind, and the startup eventually dominates. AI requires learning, and startups may be more willing to invest in this learning than their more established rivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI-enabled products are often inferior at first because it takes time to train a prediction machine to perform as well as a hard-coded device that follows human instructions rather than learning on its own. However, once deployed, an AI can continue to learn and improve, leaving its unintelligent competitors’ products behind. It is tempting for established companies to take a wait-and-see approach, standing on the sidelines and observing the progress in AI applied to their industry. That may work for some companies, but others will find it difficult to catch up once their competitors get ahead in the training and deployment of their AI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strategic decision concerns timing—when to release AI tools into the wild. AI tools are, initially, trained in house, away from customers. However, they learn faster when they are deployed into commercial use because they are exposed to real operating conditions and often to greater volumes of data. The benefit to deploying earlier is faster learning, and the cost is greater risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 18: Managing AI risk\n",
    "\n",
    "AI carries many types of risk\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predictions from AIs can lead to discrimination.\n",
    "2. AIs are ineffective when data is sparse. This creates quality risk, particularly of the “unknown known” type, in which a prediction is provided with confidence, but is false. \n",
    "3. Incorrect input data can fool prediction machines, leaving their users vulnerable to attack by hackers. \n",
    "4. Just as in biodiversity, the diversity of prediction machines involves a trade-off between individual- and system-level outcomes. Less diversity may benefit individual-level performance, but increase the risk of massive failure. \n",
    "5. Prediction machines can be interrogated, exposing you to intellectual property theft and to attackers who can identify weaknesses. \n",
    "6. Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 19: Beyond business\n",
    "\n",
    "Jobs are one thing. The income they generate is another. Opening up trade often creates competition, and competition causes prices to drop. If the competition is with human labor, then wages fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with trade between countries, winners and losers from trade with machines will appear. Jobs will still exist, but some people will have less appealing jobs than they have now. In other words, if you understand the benefits of free trade, then you should appreciate the gains from prediction machines. The key policy question isn’t about whether AI will bring benefits but about how those benefits will be distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the machines’ share of work continues to increase, then workers’ income will fall, while that accruing to the owners of the AI will rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second trend leading to increased inequality is that technology is often skill-biased. It disproportionately increases the wages of highly educated people and might even decrease the wages of the less educated.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI will unambiguously enhance productivity. The problem isn’t wealth creation; it’s distribution. AI might exacerbate the income inequality problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The second trade-off is innovation versus competition\n",
    "\n",
    "The third trade-off is performance versus privacy."
