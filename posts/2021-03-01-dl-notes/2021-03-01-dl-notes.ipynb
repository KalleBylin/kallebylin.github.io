    "## What is a perceptron?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perceptrons were originally brain models created to understand how the brain works. A perceptron as we know it encodes several principles about how the brain works and then evolved into an algorithm for supervised binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1960's, Frank Rosenblatt published the book `Principles of Neurodynamics: Perceptrons and the Theory of Brain Mechanisms`. It is curious that this fundamental block for AI was, in the author's mind, a tool for understanding the human brain and not for pattern recognition (even though he encouraged this use as well):\n",
    "\n",
    "> For this writer, the perceptron program is _not_ primarily concerned with the invention of devices for \"artificial intelligence\", but rather with investigating the physical structures and neurodynamic principles which underlie \"natural intelligence\". *A perceptron is first and foremost a brain model, not an invention for pattern recognition* [emphasis added]\" (p. viii). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the perceptron is actually a simplification and abstraction which has allowed us to discover principles for how the brain works. These same principles were then also used to create pattern recognition machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rosenblatt explicitly recognizes that his model is a direct descendant of the model created by McCulloch and Pitts, and influenced by the theories of Hebb and Hayek. \n",
    "\n",
    "Main components of a perceptron in Rosenblatt's book:\n",
    "- **Environment**: The environment generates the information that is initially passed on to the perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signal generating units**: Each unit receives a signal and generates an output signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signal propagation functions**: These are rules that define how signals are generated and transmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory functions**: These are rules that define how properties of the perceptron can be changed in response to certain activity."

    "## What is an activation function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to Rosenblatt's book, activation functions are essentially signal propagation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a neuron receives a signal, the activation function decides if the signal is passed on and how strong the output signal becomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We already learned about the step function. This activation is often not ideal for multiple reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the result is binary. But sometimes we are more interested in also knowing the degree of certainty, so I probability might be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also want to have a wider range of values. When predicting age, for example, binary values of 0 or 1 will be of little value. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of different activation functions have been developed by researchers. Three common activation functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sigmoid function**\n",
    "Has a great property of having outputs between 0 and 1 and therefore can be interpreted as probabilities. The function is also smooth and easy to differentiate which makes learning easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be problematic when the input signal has very large positive or negative values. At those points the derivative is very close to 0 and learning becomes very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperbolic function**\n",
    "This is another smooth function with a range of values between -1 and 1. This is interesting because sometimes a signal might have a reverse effect on the output and the hyperbolic function allows us to include this type of relationship in the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rectified linear unit (ReLU)**\n",

    "## What is a neural network?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A neural network is a directed system of connected neurons which is capable of propagating a signal received from the environment and produces an output signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neurons are generally organized in different layers which allow us to break free from linearity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity means that we are also assuming monotonicity. In other words, an increase in an input value always increases the output value if the corresponding weight is positive (and will always decrease the output value if the weight is negative).\n",

    "This works fine in examples like the one seen above where we turn on a lightbulb depending on how much energy we get from each battery.\n",
    "\n",
